# SentinelOps - An Open Source Tactical Ops Monitoring and Management System

## Description
SentinelOps is an open-source, modular software platform for managing complex operational environments that require high levels of security and situational awareness. This tool could be used by small security firms, private investigation teams, and even niche project managers who need secure, real-time insights into operations in critical or complex environments.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Situational Awareness Dashboard:**
  - Visual, map-based interface showing real-time data from multiple inputs like team GPS locations, drone feeds, and critical asset positions.
  - Integrations with weather data APIs, local incident reports, and any relevant security or threat intelligence feeds.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
  - Access levels based on roles, so users can access only the data they need for their tasks, increasing security within the software itself.
  - End-to-end encryption for communication channels and data transmission, ensuring operational confidentiality.
- **Automated Risk Assessment and Notifications:**
  - Automatically assesses threat levels based on data inputs and user-defined criteria, with customizable alerts and notifications.
  - Features to categorize risk (e.g., low, medium, high) and suggest preconfigured action plans for operators.
- **Incident Reporting and Response Tracking:**
  - Allows users to document and manage incident reports in real time, supporting detailed descriptions, attachments (photos, documents), and team assignment.
  - Response tracking to log each action taken during an incident, aiding post-incident analysis.
- **Data Analytics and Visualization Tools:**
  - Graphical analysis tools for reviewing past operations and detecting patterns in incidents or responses.
  - Exportable reports that include heat maps, incident frequencies, and timelines, ideal for briefing stakeholders.
- **Lightweight API for External Integrations:**
  - API support for integrating third-party tools and custom software for data collection or analysis.
  - Enables developers to build add-ons specific to their team or region, fostering a modular approach.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React or Vue for dynamic, interactive UI elements, paired with map and data visualization libraries (like Mapbox or D3.js).
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express for API handling, WebSocket for real-time data streaming, MongoDB or PostgreSQL for data storage.
- **Security:** Encryption via OpenSSL, JWT for secure token-based authentication, and OAuth for third-party integrations.
- **Deployment:** Docker for containerization, supporting flexible deployment on-premises or in the cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure).

## Potential Use Cases
- Private security firms managing client protection.
- Crisis management teams needing operational visibility.
- Researchers studying threat modeling and data analysis in security-focused settings.

This project could add a valuable tool to the open-source community, especially for smaller teams that canâ€™t afford the high-cost commercial solutions for secure operations management.
