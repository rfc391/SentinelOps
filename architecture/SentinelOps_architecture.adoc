= SentinelOps Architecture Overview

SentinelOps is designed for scalability, security, and real-time processing. The architecture integrates various cutting-edge technologies:

== Components

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Kafka and RabbitMQ for message queuing and event handling.

2. **AI Processing**
   - OpenCV, ONNX, and NVIDIA Triton for real-time AI inference and analytics.

3. **Data Storage**
   - InfluxDB for time-series data.
   - PostgreSQL or Cloudflare D1 for transactional operations.
   - immudb with IPFS for immutable archival.

4. **Security**
   - Cloudflare Zero Trust for secure access control.
   - Quantum-safe encryption (QKD + PQC).

5. **Performance**
   - Cloudflare Workers for edge computing.
   - Redis for high-speed caching.

6. **Transport**
   - gRPC with Protobuf for low-latency communication.
   - Quiche/HTTP3 for fast and secure data delivery.

== Deployment Model
- **Containers**: Docker-based microservices.
- **Scalability**: Supports horizontal scaling using Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
